🎵 Data Engineering: Data Modeling with Cassandra
Project: Data Modeling with Cassandra
Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my project on Data Modeling with Cassandra. 

In this project, I worked on creating a data model for a startup called Sparkify, which wants to analyze the data they've collected on songs and user activity from their new music streaming app. 🎶

Project Overview
Sparkify's analysis team is super curious about what songs users are listening to. 

🎧 However, querying the data is challenging because it currently sits in a directory of CSV files containing user activity. 📂

So, they brought me on board as a data engineer to tackle this problem! My mission is to:

Create an Apache Cassandra database 🗄️
Design tables to enable efficient queries on song play data 🎤
Run queries provided by Sparkify's analytics team to generate meaningful insights 📊


What I Did
In this project, I:

Data Modeling: Designed and created tables in Apache Cassandra to run specific queries.
ETL Pipeline: Completed an ETL pipeline using Python to process and insert data into Cassandra tables. 🐍
The project template I used included all the necessary imports and provided a structure for the ETL pipeline, making it easier to process the data efficiently.

How It Works
Data Import: Transferred data from a set of CSV files within a directory.
Data Processing: Streamlined the CSV files to model the data.
Data Insertion: Inserted the processed data into Apache Cassandra tables.
